  # Get the most recent WAR file from the [http://code.google.com/p/jwatch/downloads/list Downloads Section]. It should be labeled something like jwatch-(VERSION).zip
  # Unpack the zip file and deploy the war within it to your application server.
  # Point your browser to http://HOST:PORT/jwatch
  # Note: You must have JMX enabled for JWatch to communicate with your Quartz instances: 

== Creating a Quartz Monitor Connection ==

JWatch communicates with Quartz Instances on any server anywhere using JMX, so your Quartz instances must have
JMX exposed and Quartz must also be exposing its internal MBeans.

Sample JVM parameters:
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=2911
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dorg.quartz.scheduler.jmx.export=true
