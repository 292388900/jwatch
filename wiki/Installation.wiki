= Installation Instructions =

  # Get the most recent WAR file from the [http://code.google.com/p/jwatch/downloads/list Downloads Section]. It should be labeled something like jwatch-(VERSION).zip
  # Unpack the zip file and deploy the war within it to your application server.
  # Point your browser to http://HOST:PORT/jwatch
  # Note: You must have JMX enabled in *your* application for JWatch to communicate with your Quartz instances: 

== Configuring JMX in your Application ==

JWatch communicates with Quartz Instances using JMX, so the JVM Quartz is running on, will have to have JMX enabled, *and* Quartz must also be exposing its internal MBeans.

Sample JVM parameters:
{{{
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=2911
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dorg.quartz.scheduler.jmx.export=true
}}}

== Creating a Quartz Monitor ==

  # Click the "Add New Quartz Instance" link on the top-right <img src="http://jwatch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/site/images/ss/addinstance.png"/>
